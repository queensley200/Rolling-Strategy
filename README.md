# Rolling Strategy 

Implementing a **rolling deployment strategy** for Kubernetes using Helm and GitHub Actions, with support for blue/green and rolling updates.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates best-practice deployment patterns for production-grade applications on Kubernetes:

- Uses **Helm charts** to package blue/green and standard rolling update deployments.
- Integrates **GitHub Actions CI** to:
  1. Build Docker image from source.
  2. Push to Docker Hub registry.
  3. Deploy to Kubernetes (blue/green or rolling) via Helm.
- Offers safe, zero-downtime deploys with environment toggles.
